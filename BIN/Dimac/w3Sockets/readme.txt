This is not much of a readme file is it. Well we thought that we'd
provide all the latest information you need on the web instead.

Code samples and a complete reference can be found 
on http://tech.dimac.net/

Note:
	w3Sockets requires Winsock2.
	Winsock can be downloaded free from 
		ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winsock/winsock2/
