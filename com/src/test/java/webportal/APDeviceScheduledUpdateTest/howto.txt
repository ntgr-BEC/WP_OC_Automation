This is a guideline for run this feature.

* Make sure that all 4 devices are online with the latest version.
* Only testng-APDeviceScheduledUpdateTest.xml (5 testcases) is supported
* Device tag used for all 4 devices are: SW1, AP1, BR1, ORBI1 in com\src\test\resources\config_webportal.xml
* To setup a lower version of each devices(each one of switch, ap, br, ob), modify template below in com\src\test\resources\config_dut.xml 
    1. Note for switch/ap it's a file name:
        <SWAP111>
            <Ip_Address>10.0.1.111</Ip_Address>
            <Firmware>http://[your http ip]/[switch/ap old version file name]</Firmware>
        </SWAP111>
    2. For BR/OB it points to folder name that contains br/ap file name:
        <BROB111>
            <Ip_Address>192.168.22.111</Ip_Address>
            <Model>BR500</Model>
            <Firmware>http://[your http ip]/[br/ob old version file name]</Firmware>
        </BROB111>
    3. All these firmwares are uploaded to a http server
    
p.s.
1. If you don't have http server, you can use a com\bin\miniweb\start_server.bat, all firmware are saved to com\bin\miniweb\htdocs.
2. If you had some problem to get low version builds for ap/br/ob, use com\bin\miniweb\make_high_br_orbi.py/make_high_ap_build.py(give file name to its option) to generate.
